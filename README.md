Hello, this 2d unity webGL game was made originally by me, YL77.
It's published under CC0, Creative Commons Zero meaning there are no copyright restrictions and you may use, modify and edit all game files as you please without needing to worry about credits.

I've published all the game files and data on the main repository as well as the built zipped data if you want to host the game on your website and it should be called solveordrown.zip
thanks for checking out my page.
